# Friday Night Funkin': Lore Engine
Psych Engine with some neat tweaks.

Originally intended for an FNF mod for my Chemistry class, but that never came through.

Extra features include:
- Haxe scripting support
- Custom states
- Overrideable states
- Improved frame rate counter
- Aesthetic and customizability improvements
- Colorblind mode
- Hitsounds
- Marv hit windows
- Dual vocal track support
- Added LUA functions
- Custom noteskins per-character
- Shadertoy shader support
- More to come!

NOTE: If you're running on Linux, please use the official Linux build instead of running the game through Wine. FNF has quite a few input, stuttering, and minimization issues with Wine at the moment.

use haxe 4.2.5 bozos
